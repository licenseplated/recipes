# Takoyaki

Crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside, a little bit savory and a little bit sweet, takoyaki are a popular street food in Japan made with a simple dashi-based batter filled with bits of octopus, bonito flakes, tenkasu, scallions and pickled red ginger, then fried in a molded pan to achieve an ideal bite-sized shape. You can make them at home with a little practice and a takoyaki maker. The eggy batter might seem messy at first, but with a little finesse, you can mold them into practically perfect spheres. Practice with a few to get the hang of the process. Octopus is traditional (tako means "octopus" and yaki means "fried" in Japanese), but you can swap in cooked sausage or shrimp, edamame, corn or cheese. Serve takoyaki with any (or all) of the suggested toppings: takoyaki sauce, Kewpie mayonnaise and pickled red ginger, all of which are available at Japanese markets and online.

## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon/3 grams dashi powder
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 cup/120 grams all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
- Vegetable oil or nonstick spray, as needed
- 4 to 5 ounces cooked octopus, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons/1 1/2 grams dried bonito flakes, ground to fine powder, plus more large flakes for serving
- 1/4 cup/15 grams tenkasu (tempura scraps)
- 3 scallions, thinly sliced, set 1/3 aside for serving
- 2 tablespoons chopped pickled red ginger, plus more for serving
- Takoyaki sauce, for serving
- Kewpie mayonnaise, for serving
- Aonori (dried crushed green seaweed), for serving (optional)

## Steps

- Prepare the dashi: In a medium, heat-proof bowl, combine the dashi powder with 2 cups of boiling water. Stir until the powder dissolves and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.
- Make the batter: Once the dashi has cooled for 15 minutes, add the eggs and soy sauce to the bowl and whisk until combined. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk until well combined. Using a fine-mesh sieve and a spatula, strain the batter into a (2-cup) glass measuring cup with a pouring spout. (Alternatively, you can use a ladle to pour the batter.)
- Heat the takoyaki maker according to instructions. (If using a takoyaki pan on the stove, heat on medium-high.) Brush or spray each hole and the entire top plate generously with oil. When the oil begins to smoke, stir the batter to incorporate again, and slowly pour into each hole, filling them to the top. It's OK if some batter spills onto the takoyaki maker's plate.
- Place 2 to 3 pieces (depending on the size of the takoyaki maker) of octopus in each hole. Sprinkle on some of the ground bonito flakes, tenkasu, scallions and pickled red ginger. The batter will spill over and that's OK. Cook until the bottoms of the takoyaki start to set and are slightly brown, adjusting the heat as necessary, about 4 minutes.
- Using the takoyaki skewers or chopsticks, break the spilled batter covering the plate and connecting the takoyaki, and flip them 90 degrees, while tucking the spilled parts into themselves. The takoyaki will be half cooked. Fill with a little more batter and cook for 4 minutes.
- Break any spilled batter as above, tucking it into the takoyaki, and flip 90 degrees again. Brush the top of the takoyaki with more oil, and cook for about 4 minutes, until browned and crisp on the outside. As they cook, continue flipping until evenly brown; the takoyaki will eventually form into spheres. (Check to make sure the takoyaki maker is evenly browning across the chambers; if one side is browning faster, remove the browned takoyaki and move the remaining to the other chambers until they're ready.) Remove the takoyaki to a platter and use any leftover batter and fillings to cook additional takoyaki.
- Drizzle the takoyaki with takoyaki sauce and Kewpie mayonnaise, and top with bonito flakes, remaining scallions, pickled ginger and aonori, if using. Takoyaki is best served right away â€” just be mindful that the insides are hot.
